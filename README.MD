# PROJECT DESCRIPTION (PART ONE)
This project is a homework to teach students on
how to get Pycharm set up with Docker, Flask, MySQL, and Postman

# POSTMAN SCREENSHOT

I was unable to perform a GET request through the Postman platform

![OUTPUT](screenshots/postman.png)

# SQL DATA SCREENSHOT

I was unable to get a successful test connection, despite many attempts to fix this.
Eventually, it got to a point where my Docker stopped working properly.
